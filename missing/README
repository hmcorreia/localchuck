# What is missing

## Terraform
I ran into some problems with Terraform, and it's connection to AWS. 
I am still providing here the attempts that I had while trying to make it work.

##Docker Compose
I also faced some difficulty with this method. 
I believe my private VPS couldnÂºt handle it, as I could create 3 managed instances and alternate between them, but started to have errors a bit later. 
So, I also provide the compose file, for your reference if needed.
