# What is missing

## Terraform
I ran into some problems with Terraform, and it's connection to AWS. I am still provining here the attemotss that I had while trying to make it work.

##Docker Compose
I also faced some difficulty with this method. I believe my private VPS couldnÂºt handle it, as I could create 3 instances and alternate between them, but started to have errors a bit later. I also provide here my attempts, for your reference if needed.
